## Usage

- Create a [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) environment: `conda create -n aisearch python=3.9`
- Activate environment: `conda activate aisearch`
- Clone this repo.
- Change into the project directory.
- Install packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create an `.env` file and input your OpenAI API keys:

```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

- Run the notebook and create the search index with the Open Source database [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/).
- Change into the app directory: `cd _streamlit_app/`
- Start the app: `streamlit run aisearch.py`

## What does the code do?

This application allows you to search the [Berlin Open Data catalog](https://daten.berlin.de/). It combines exact **lexical keyword searches** with **semantic searches based on meaning and similarity**. The search supports **multiple languages**, including all European languages and many others.

For this prototype app we use OpenAI's embeddings for convenience. We also tested these **open source models with [SentenceTransformers](https://sbert.net/) with very good results**:

- [PM-AI/bi-encoder_msmarco_bert-base_german](https://huggingface.co/PM-AI/bi-encoder_msmarco_bert-base_german) - 350 tokens context length
- [Jina AI jina-embeddings-v2-base-de](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-de) - 8192 tokens context length

> [!Note]
> The app sends all your search queries to an [embedding interface (API) at OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings). Please avoid entering sensitive information that you do not want or are not permitted to share with third-party providers like OpenAI.

## What is semantic search?

Unlike a lexical search, which looks for exact keywords, a semantic search considers text that is semantically similar but does not have to match the search term exactly. For example, a semantic search for the word _disease_ can find documents containing the words _illness_, _virus_, _infection_, _treatment_, or _healthcare_ without the word _disease_ appearing in the documents.

Semantic search uses statistical methods and Machine Learning (ML). By analyzing large amounts of text, ML language models for semantic search have learned word and sentence similarities, enabling them to search for documents based on these similarities. While semantic search has many advantages, it is not exact but approximate. Therefore, **semantic search results itself may not be complete and can include false hits or miss relevant entries**.

**Combining lexical and semantic to hybrid search gives you the best of both worlds.** You get exact lexical but also semantically similar matches in your search results.

## Project team

This is an independent project aimed at improving access to Berlin's Open Data. The original codebase was adapted from a similar project for the Canton of Zurich.

## Feedback and contributing

I would love to hear from you. Please share your feedback of this repo and let me know how you use the code. You can share your ideas by opening an issue or a pull request.
